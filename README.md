## Introduction

This project aims to provide an easy-to-print PDF version of the rules found on the game's website. Whether you prefer having a physical copy or want to share the rules with others offline, this booklet has got you covered.

Inside this booklet, you will find comprehensive explanations of the game mechanics, card interactions, and various strategies to enhance your gameplay experience. It serves as a handy reference guide for both new players looking to learn the game and experienced players seeking to deepen their understanding.

By compiling the rules into a PDF format, we aim to make it convenient for you to access and print the rules whenever you need them. No more worrying about internet connectivity or scrolling through web pages â€“ simply open the PDF and have all the information at your fingertips.
