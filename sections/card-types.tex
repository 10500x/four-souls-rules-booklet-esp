  \section{Treasure Cards}
  Treasure cards are found in the treasure deck. Whilst \textbf{in play} (see \textbf{Game Zones}), a treasure card is an object referred to as an item. This means items are either controlled by a player or in the shop.

  Players will acquire items throughout the game. Items have a wide variety of abilities that can range from modifying gameplay to interacting with other players and monsters (see Abilities). Players place any items they control face up in front of them.

  Any time a card instructs a player to gain treasure, they gain that many cards from the top of the treasure deck, putting them into play under their control.

  A playerâ€™s starting item is considered an item. Starting items intrinsically have the starting item quality.
